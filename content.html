  <h1>What We See and Assume</h1>
      <p>Many times, more often than not, you may know someone who has a favorite
        character. You could assume this character to be from their favorite TV show or movie.
        However, you would come to realization that this favorite character is in fact a real human
        being as is everyone else. This so-called character is realistic, seemingly more important than 
        other characters, because people praise them and look up to them. In other words, they have been 
        made to be famous. This character is, not surprisingly, a celebrity. You hear their name and you 
        know exactly who everyone is talking about. I would say social media has a great impact as to how 
        so many individuals know this one character. Their favorite character turns into their own personality.
        How one character can have such a large following (almost religiously) is beyond reason. Many individuals 
        have an obsession with one person whom they will never meet.

  <h2>What We Don't Know and Consider</h2>
  <p>There is nothing quite remarkable about celebrities in our modern era. Most fans will adore their 
    favorite celebrity without considering how pointless their behavior is. This all ties back to the 
    impact social media has on our generation, because people put so much emphasis on celebrities without 
    taking the time to think about the consequences, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, a 
    celebrity can be just about anyone, regardless of their status. This includes someone who is a famous 
    singer to a politician. When thinking about hierarchy in society, the so-called celebrity can be someone 
    who is popular compared to someone who has been made to feel inferior. That superiority, in turn, can do 
    more harm than good to others, depending on the situation. In reality, no one is perfect or superior over the 
    other; we are all equal and bleed the same.
