    <h1>About Maria</h1>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <section>
    <p>My name is <u>Maria</u>, 
        and I am rather excited to begin coding in HTML. 
        <br>My dream is to become a <em>web developer</em> or a <em>graphic designer</em>.
         <br>In taking IMS222, I can practice coding and reviewing what my website looks like. 
         <br>With regards to myself, I officially changed my major from Computer Science <br> to ETBD 
         (<b>Emerging Technology in Business and Design</b>) within the Applied Concentration.
         <br>This career path opens a wide variety of job options for me, concerning my skills I will be using 
         <br> throughout this course and beyond.</p>

    <section>Throughout my journey at Miami University, I learned several things. As a fourth-year undergraduate student, 
        not having graduated by the end of this year seems to be devastating. 
        However, I feel the opposite way and am excited for the new things that are to come my way, 
        especially once I transfer to the new major. As a former major in Computer Science, 
        I gained some knowledge about technology and what goes on inside computers, 
        but I gained most of my programming knowledge through my experience taking CSE174. 
        Other than that, I have written various types of writing from previous courses I have taken. 
        I enjoy writing a lot, and have written formally, scientifically, etc. 
        I hope to use these skills throughout my career and to build a great resume. </section>
