    <h1>The Benefits of Coffee</h1>
    <section><b><em>Coffee</em></b> is enjoyed by several individuals throughout the world.
        What brings individuals together to enjoy this gift from Mother Nature
        is its sense of community and major health benefits. That being said,
        coffee alone can bring individuals together, improve cognitive function
        and cardiovascular health, and much more. We will dive into these categories
        to learn more about nature's most delightful treasure. The first thing to
        consider, however, is why someone would want to pick up a cup of coffee
        in the first place. Typically, it all starts with an invitation, either 
        from someone one knows or may not know and would like to get to know them more.

    <h2>Coffee in Real Time</h2>
    <p>Coffee is shared between those working in a business together. The idea of
        sharing a cup of coffee goes a long way into making newer connections with someone.
        Sharing coffee with someone one knows already will strengthen already-made connections
        while making new memories with such individual. Many times, the first time people have
        met have been with a cup of coffee in their hands. Nevertheless, coffee is a great way
        to bond with those whom you know or would like to know more. Although not exactly inexpensive, 
        it is rather a cheapter alternative than taking someone out on a formal dinner.

    <h2>Additional Health-Related Facts About Coffee</h2>
    <p>Other than keeping one alert and increasing one's energy levels, coffee has numerous
        health benefits for the body. One being that it prevents cardiovascular disease. 
        Caffeine is shown to lower the bad type of cholesterol in the body. Although it can 
        cause jitters and heart palpitations taken at high doses, a moderate level of caffeine 
        is great for the heart. It may prevent blood clots from forming, as the caffeine 
        circulates throughout the veins. Out of the many foods that help lower the risk of 
        heart disease or failure, coffee is a liquid that does the trick and even protects 
        against strokes. Additionally, coffee aids in digestion as it affects the acids in the 
        stomach and gastrointestinal tract. However, at the same time, coffee is known to 
        suppress one's appetite, and so one should consider whether they would want to 
        consume coffee at a particular time.
